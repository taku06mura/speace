This is a matching app specialized in sports.

・ User registration, login, logout

・ Participant recruitment, posting function

・ Team creation function

・ Group chat function


## Production background
I like sports and want to exercise, but I don't belong to a team. With people who do not want to belong to the team but want to feel free to join,

I want to play a game, but there are not enough people. Connect people who want to strengthen the team by increasing the number of teams.

Or I wanted to create a platform to connect teams and teams to hold games and tournaments,

I created it because the team I originally belonged to could not work due to a lack of people.

## Device points

From the user's point of view, it looks simple and looks like SNS.

Considering actual development, we are aware of detailed commits and pull requests for each function.
